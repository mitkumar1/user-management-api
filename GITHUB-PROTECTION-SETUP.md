# GitHub Branch Protection Configuration Guide

## Quick Setup Checklist

### ‚úÖ New Branch Ruleset Configuration

**Basic Information:**
- Ruleset Name: `Protect Master Branch`
- Enforcement status: `Active`
- Bypass list: `Empty` (or add specific admins if needed)

**Target Branches:**
```
‚úÖ Include default branch
OR
‚úÖ Add branch: master
```

**Rules to Enable:**

### üõ°Ô∏è Core Protection Rules

#### 1. Require a pull request before merging ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ Required number of approvals: 1
‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
‚úÖ Require review from code owners (if applicable)
‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
```

#### 2. Restrict updates ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ Only allow users with bypass permission to update matching refs
```

#### 3. Block force pushes ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ Prevent users with push access from force pushing
```

#### 4. Require status checks to pass ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ Choose status checks: validate
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
```

### üîß Optional but Recommended

#### 5. Restrict deletions ‚úÖ
```
‚úÖ Only allow users with bypass permissions to delete matching refs
```

#### 6. Require linear history ‚ö° (Optional)
```
‚úÖ Prevent merge commits from being pushed to matching refs
Note: This requires rebasing instead of merge commits
```

### ‚ùå Leave Disabled (for most projects)

- ‚ùå Restrict creations
- ‚ùå Require deployments to succeed (unless you have deployment pipelines)
- ‚ùå Require signed commits (unless you need cryptographic verification)
- ‚ùå Require code scanning results (unless using GitHub Advanced Security)

## Expected Behavior After Setup

### ‚úÖ What Will Happen:
- ‚úÖ Direct pushes to master will be blocked
- ‚úÖ All changes must go through pull requests
- ‚úÖ PRs require 1 approval before merging
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions must pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Force pushes to master are prevented
- ‚úÖ Master branch cannot be deleted

### ‚ùå What Will Be Blocked:
- ‚ùå `git push origin master` (direct push)
- ‚ùå `git push --force origin master` (force push)
- ‚ùå Merging PRs without approval
- ‚ùå Merging PRs with failing status checks

## Testing Your Setup

After configuration, test with these commands:

```bash
# This should be BLOCKED
git checkout master
echo "test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test direct push"
git push origin master
# Expected: remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed

# This should WORK
git checkout -b test/protection-check
git push origin test/protection-check
# Then create PR via GitHub UI
```

## Workflow Integration

Your `git-workflow.ps1` script will help developers work within these constraints:

```powershell
# Create feature branch (will work)
.\git-workflow.ps1 new-feature my-change

# Try to push to master (will be blocked)
git checkout master
git push origin master  # ‚ùå Blocked by rules

# Proper workflow (will work)
git checkout feature/my-change
.\git-workflow.ps1 push  # ‚úÖ Allowed
# Create PR via GitHub UI
```

## Troubleshooting

### If PRs are blocked:
1. Check that GitHub Actions workflow is passing
2. Ensure required approvals are met
3. Verify all conversations are resolved

### If direct pushes still work:
1. Verify ruleset is `Active`
2. Check that `master` branch is targeted
3. Confirm `Restrict updates` is enabled

### For emergency access:
1. Add yourself to bypass list temporarily
2. Make critical fixes
3. Remove from bypass list afterward

## Success Indicators

‚úÖ Repository Settings ‚Üí Rules shows active ruleset
‚úÖ Direct pushes to master are rejected
‚úÖ PRs show required status checks
‚úÖ Merge button is disabled until approval
‚úÖ Branch deletion attempts are blocked
